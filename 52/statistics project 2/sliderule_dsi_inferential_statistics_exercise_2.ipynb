    "### Examining racial discrimination in the US job market\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Discuss statistical significance.\n",
